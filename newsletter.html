	<h3>what AIESEC gives to human kind :</h3>

	<p>AIESEC is a non-political, independent, not-for-profit organization run by students and recent graduates of institutions of higher education. Our members are interested in world issues, leadership, and management. AIESEC does not discriminate on the basis of ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion or national/social origin.</p>

	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u-74sc4IIs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u-74sc4IIs</a>

	<p>We are passionately driven by one cause, peace and fulfillment of humankind's potential. AIESEC and the United Nations have a rich relationship of mutual belief and passion towards achieving peace in the world. We firmly believes that young people need to be at the center of the global development process. And so AIESEC and the United Nations have been working together to ensure that the world that we create tomorrow is aligned with the needs of the youth today.
		
	<div>Here is two of the united nations sustainable development goals that we would like to share with you today : climate action and gender equality. (the couple of SDG's will change each time)</div>

	<h3>what AIESEC has been giving to its members :</h3>

	<section class="blocgris">

		<div>AIESEC is more than an association, it is an experience.As a matter of fact, AIESECers get to know each other as much as they get to know themselves by living, sharing, learning with an other :</div>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Induction Day : this day is the induction process for the new members in order to introduce them to the AIESEC experience. First impressions are vital to establish strong relationships between members.
				<div>Anyway, time for our newies to share with you!</div>

				<ol>
					<li>Why did you choose to join AIESEC ?
						<p>
							“When I received the email proposing to apply, I hesitated a lot. I was clearly afraid of being alone in a world I didn't know, but on the one hand this fear was my new challenge. I also wanted to do something, by which I mean: "to be part of something" and to be able to have new life goals that are more stimulating in the short term than just succeeding in my studies.” Chiara di Bernardo
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>How did you experience Induction day ?
						<p>
							“I immediately felt that this day was fully up to my expectations, I especially perceived that it was much more than an association but really a big family with lots of nice and motivated people who make us want to give the best of ourselves in this adventure.” Lorenzo Bernasconi
						</p>

					</li>

				</ol>
			</li>

			<li>Kick-off : in this event, time to deal with the real purpose of AIESEC! Swiss Local commities gather themselves to talk about the importance of developping leadership skills and improving the SDG's awareness.
				<p>
					"Kick-off is an amazing experience, which allowed us all to get closer! What I also love is the fact that either as a member, a VP or a LCP, we are still learning! Here is one of the AIESEC strengths, everything is focused on humans and knowledge." Olga Bastiat, Vice-President Innovation.
				</p>

				<p>
					"Kick-Off 2021 was a really challenging experience for me since it was my first AIESEC national conference as president of LC Lausanne. Fortunately, everything went well and we spent 3 very interesting days where we all learnt a lot about AIESEC." Mélanie Demaurex, Local Comitee President.
				</p>

				<p>
					"As soon as I joined AIESEC, one of the first things I heard was : "conferences are the best things you can attend to in AIESEC". Despite the fact that Kick-off was online, I had the opportunity to get closer with many people and to learn lots of new skills just like time management or team spirit." Maher Boukris, Vice-President Business Development.
				</p>



			</li>

			<li>One of Our Alumnis also wants to share with you :
				<p>
					"My experience in AIESEC in Lausanne represents an important part of my student life. Indeed, beyond the people I met and the things I was able to learn as a member, My Vice-President position took my AIESEC experience a big step further. Becoming a VP allowed me to work with MY team, take real initiatives and finally learn to assume my entire role as a member of the executive comitee." Mohamed Ayadi, Ex-Vice-President Finance/Legalities.

				"Everywhere you can hear the words : "Global Warming", "sustainable this","sustainable that". But hearing about it and talking about it is not enough. It is our generation's duty to really start doing something about the energetic issues we are already facing. But in order to do something you need to know what the problem is and what solution has a significant impact or not." said Nicolas Profumo, Innovation Team Leader about Mr.Jean-Marc Jancovici's free online course on Energy :
